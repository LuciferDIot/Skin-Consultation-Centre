Skin Consultation Center - Swing Application

This is a Swing-based application for Skin Consultation Center, where users can make an appointment for a doctor reservation and managers can access and edit the doctor details.
When the user logs in for the first time, they will be directed to the UI. If the user chooses the manager option, it will direct them to the console where they can access and edit the doctor details. Otherwise, the user will be directed to the next UI where they can make an appointment for a doctor reservation.

Features:
